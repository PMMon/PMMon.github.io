Hi my name is Sho.  Here are a few quick facts about me.  


* **I was born in Tokyo, Japan**.  Because my mom is an American Citizen, I get to be a dual-citizen.   Being raised in a culture so different from American Culture was challenging but ultimately super rewarding.

* **Grew up on the beautiful island of O'ahu** -  I consider that island my childhood home.  I grew up surrounded by nature and a kind of laid-back communalism that doesn't stifle individuality.  

* **I've lived in Northern California since 2008** - I went to a Waldorf high school in Sacramento and went to college at UC Berkeley.  Got to enjoy the bay for 7+ yrs and now I'm back in Sacramento.   

Overall, it's safe to say I'm **pretty fucking lucky**. :)
