### Research Interest in Statistics

> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**

I've taken [Leo Breiman's advice](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213290) to heart.  Once in a PhD program, I want to stay focused on applied statistical research on *"important real world problems"*.  

I expect this to change over time but my current research interests are:
* unsupervised machine learning
* high dimensional statistics
* environmental statistics

### Current Research Project: Aerosol Characterization & Atmospheric Processing 

> "For those of us studying aerosols, it's a fascinatingly complex problem. And while this complexity challenges our observational and modeling capabilities, aerosols are a critical component of our atmosphere. If we want to better quantify climate change, we must not only understand greenhouse gases, but aerosols as well." - Art Sedlacek, an atmospheric scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy

My current research falls under the domains of **aerosol chemistry** and
**atmospheric science**.  I work to understand the properties and long-term behaviors of aerosols through statistical analysis. Specifically, I focus on analyzing the measurements of non-refractory sub-micron particulate matter (NR-PM<sub>1</sub>).    I work for [Professor Qi Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/qizhanggroup/pe) in the Atmospheric Science Graduate Group at UC Davis.

Understanding the effect of aerosols on our climate is technically challenging. They are tiny and difficult to measure.  They both reflect and absorb light, making it challenging to quantify their net effect.  Furthermore, aerosols are extremely diverse both in their physical and chemical make-up.  

Nonetheless, these tiny particles change how the sun warms our planet and researchers believe that they also affects cloud formations. Analysis of co-located measurements of meteorology, radiation, and aerosols are necessary in order to better understand them.

To better understand NR-PM<sub>1</sub>, we use mass concentration measurements from Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors (ACSMs).  This instrument is co-located with other instruments that measure meteorological properties as part of US Dept. of Energy's [ARM Program](https://www.arm.gov/).  The aerosol data from ACSMs tend to not only be large in terms of the number of observations but also very highly dimensional which makes interpretation difficult. Therefore this data pose **interesting statistical challenges** in areas like **time series analysis, dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, and supervised machine learning**.

If this weren't already interesting enough, these ARM datasets are criminally under-explored (in my opinion).  This makes this one of the more fascinating data science projects around!
