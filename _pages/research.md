My current research falls under the domains of aerosol chemistry and
atmospheric science.  Broadly speaking, I work to understand the properties and long-term behaviors of particulate pollution: also known as non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM<sub>1</sub>).  

Aerosols are one the greatest sources of uncertainty in radiative forcing predicted by climate models, as highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.   Several studies have demonstrated that co-located measurements of meteorology, radiation, and aerosols are necessary to evaluate treatments of aerosol processes in climate models.

To better understand NR-PM<sub>1</sub>, we use mass concentration measurements from Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors (ACSMs) that is co-located with other meteorological measurements.  The data from ACSMs tend to not only be large in terms of the number of observations but also very highly dimensional which makes interpretation difficult. Thus, statistically speaking, I work at the intersection of ***time series analysis*** and ***factor analysis***.
