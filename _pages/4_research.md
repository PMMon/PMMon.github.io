> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**

NOTE: I'm still a first year so there's I'm mostly taking coursework before I start research.
