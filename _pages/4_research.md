> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**

General Research Interests:

* Official Statistics 
* Small Area Estimation and other model-based inference of survey data
* Dependent Data Modeling (spatial, temporal)
* Bayesian Methods
* Application in Public Policy and Ecology

I currently focus on Bayesian Small Area Estimation models. I am working on an extension to the Fay-Herriot Model using a spatial spike & slab prior.

Generally speaking, I believe [official statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_statistics) presents so many possibilities for statisticians to connect their work to public policy.
