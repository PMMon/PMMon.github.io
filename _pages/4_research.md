> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**

During my PhD, I want to build expertise in Bayesian and Spatial Statistics with primary application to ecology, climatology, or government records.
I'm still a first year so there's a lot I need to learn before I start research.
