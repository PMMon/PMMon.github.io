> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**


My interest in solving *"important real world problems"* is what drew me into statistics in the first place.
So I feel that I've always taken [Leo Breiman's advice](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213290) to heart.  

During my PhD, I want to build expertise in Bayesian and Spatial Statistics with primary application to ecology or climatology.
