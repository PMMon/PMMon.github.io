> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**

During my PhD, I want to build expertise in Spatial and Bayesian Statistics with primary application to ecology, climatology, or civic data. Within spatial statistics, I'm interested in non-stationary spatial modeling.

I'm still a first year (have not passed prelims) so there's I'm mostly taking coursework before I start research.

Here are some papers I find very interesting:
* [Review of Nonstationary Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02447)
* [A Case Study Competition Among Methods for Analyzing Large Spatial Data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-018-00348-w)
* [Meta-kriging: Scalable Bayesian modeling and inference for massive spatial datasets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00401706.2018.1437474)
* [High-Dimensional Bayesian Geostatistics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790125/)
