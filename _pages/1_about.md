### Personal

People often describe me as energetic, funny, and outgoing. I love traveling, cooking, sports, gardening, practicing meditation, and spending time with my girlfriend Laura.   I'm also blessed to have many friends and a loving family.

#### My Life Path

Long story short: I've been incredibly blessed.

**I was born in Tokyo, Japan.**  My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1]. This is why my mom and I are both dual-citizens[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots with my American upbringing was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up in Hawaii.**  You can take a person out of Hawai'i but you can't take Hawai'i out of a person. Hawai'i is a gentle, beautiful place.

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I had a blast at the Waldorf High School in Sacramento. Took a 1/2 gap year to work on a political campaign which really connected me to the Sac community.

**East Bay.** I went to UC Berkeley. As an undergrad, I was mostly interested in clean energy. I took more energy-related classes than stats/math.  After college, I worked for various clean energy companies while living in Oakland.

**A trip of a lifetime.** In 2019, I was let go from what I thought was my dream job and went on a "fuck it" trip to SE Asia. This turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life. I also met Laura when I came back to Oakland.

**Back in Sacramento.** I moved back right before the pandemic. I worked at the State Government which made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills contributing in civil service.

**Now:** Pursuing my PhD at UC Santa Cruz. I successfully finished my first year! I spend most of my weekends in Sacramento.
