### Personal-ish

People often describe me as energetic, funny, and outgoing. I love traveling, cooking, sports, gardening, practicing meditation, and spending time with my girlfriend Laura.   I'm also blessed to have many friends and a loving family.

#### My Life Path

Long story short: I've been incredibly blessed.

**I was born in Tokyo, Japan.**  My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1]. This is why my mom and I are both dual-citizens[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots with my American upbringing was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up in Hawaii.** Hawai'i is a gentle, beautiful place. So lucky to have grown up there.

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I had a blast at the Waldorf High School in Sacramento. I love Sacramento's down-to-earth sleepy feel and the best coffee scene in CA.

**East Bay.** I went to UC Berkeley. As an undergrad, I was mostly interested in clean energy (more than stats or math).  After college, I worked for various clean energy companies while living in Oakland.

**A trip of a lifetime.** In 2019, let go from what I thought was my dream job. I went on a "fuck it" trip to SE Asia. which a trip of a lifetime. I also met Laura when I came back to Oakland, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

**Back in Sacramento.** I moved back right before the pandemic. I worked at the State Government which made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills contributing in civil service.

**Now:**  Splitting my time between Santa Cruz and Sacramento while I go to grad school. I play softball and garden on my spare time.
