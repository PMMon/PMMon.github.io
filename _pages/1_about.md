### Personal

I'm always changing but people often describe me as energetic, funny, and open. I love traveling, cooking, sports, gardening, and spending time with my girlfriend Laura.  I try to value experiences more than stuff. I'm also blessed to have many friends and a loving family.   

Insight Meditation practice & Buddhist philosophy has and continues to change my life for the better.

#### A Few Highlights

**I was born in Tokyo, Japan.**  My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1]. This is why my mom and I are both dual-citizens[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots with my American upbringing was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up in Hawaii.** Hawai'i is a gentle, beautiful place. So lucky to have grown up there.

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I went to a Waldorf High School in Sacramento, which is artsy/hippy school. I love Sacramento.

**East Bay.** As an undergrad at Berkeley, I was mostly interested in clean energy (stats was secondary).  During and after college, I worked for a major solar energy developer.

**A trip of a lifetime.** In 2019, let go from what I thought was my dream job. I went on a life altering trip to SE Asia. I caught and still have a serious case of the travel bug. I met Laura when I came back to Oakland, the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

**Back in Sacramento.** I moved back right before the pandemic. I worked at the State Government which made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills contributing in civil service.

**Now:**  Splitting my time between Santa Cruz and Sacramento while I go to grad school. I play softball, bike around, and garden on my spare time.
