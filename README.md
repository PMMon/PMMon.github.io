# Academic Derrick â€” Minimal Theme for Jekyll


Derrick is a clean minimal and fast theme for a personal blog. See the original repo for full details.

I made some major edits to the Derrick blogging theme to make it more suitable for an academic page.
My goal was to create an academic page that has a more photographer-blog like feel. 

Changes made to original Derrick Theme:
* Moved the blogroll/posts away from the main page to its own section.
* Added caption to the main photo for pages and posts
* Edited the posts to make the main content rolls up together with the header
* Edited the formatting of the posts (smaller font, mostly)
