> Consider meditation and the unfolding of wisdom more like a marathon than a sprint.  Be willing to learn from everything.  This practice is for life. - Shwe Oo Min Sayadaw

Interested in trying meditation?  Here are some incredible resources I recommend:

**App**:  *Ten Percent*

By far the best meditation app that provides excellent instructions from some of the best meditation teachers in the world.  Although it presents the content in a secular fashion, it does so while respecting the Buddhist & Asian origins (unlike apps like headspace).  It also has made a lot of effort to promote teachers from various backgrounds, so chances are, you'll find one that fits your style.

You can also get live-coaching from an experienced teacher through the app!

Here is a [30 day free guest pass](https://redeem.tenpercent.com/?promo_code=TPH-ZY1U-ZFE9).  For full disclosure, I do not make any money from this link whatsoever.  

**Books for Beginners**:

*Ten Percent Happier by Dan Harris*

The book that got me interested in starting & maintaining a meditation practice.  The casual style really resonated with me.  Importantly, it doesn't oversell meditation as a fix-all practice (hence the title).  From my experience, it can take a long time to feel the benefits of meditation, so it's essential to not get frustrated when things don't magically get better. ðŸ˜„

*Waking Up by Sam Harris (no relation to Dan)*

Are you a staunch athiest or have strong allergic reaction to anything remotely spiritual?  Even if so, Sam (a long-time atheist) advocates that spirituality is essential for living an examined and happy life.  You can find a very touching quote from his book [here](https://sho-kawano.github.io/2021/09/27/why-meditate/).  He has a philosophical congnitive science background so some stuff can get a bit wonky.  The book also discusses the topics non-existence of a conceptual "self", which in my experience is not of the utmost importance in day-to-day practice. So you can ignore that stuff if it is confusing.  

Note - while philosophy is helpful, most of this stuff is not intellectual. There is limited utility in reading about meditation. At some point, you just gotta do it.

**Retreats**

Personally, I found that extended meditation retreats significantly deepened my practice.  All of the things that provide unnecessary friction in your mind may be withstood in a 10 min meditation session.  But when you're meditating for multiple days intensively, you will have to confront them.

It can be an intense experience but very worthwhile.   I also think practicing meditation with others is extremely helpful (in a retreat setting or otherwise).  Many meditation teachers and centers offer day-long retreats to help you dive deeper into practice.  This doesn't require you to shell out money or time to spend on multi-day residential retreats, which is convenient.   I personally like the day-long retreats offered by [Alexis Santos](https://www.alexissantos.io).  Here is a list of retreat centers recommended by [Ten Percent Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/retreats) if you're interested in doing something more extended.

**Books for Digging Deeper**

These books may be more beneficial to those who have practiced meditation for at least a few months.  It may take some time to get used to the jargon in these books.  That said, these books truly transformed my meditation practice.  

*Buddhism without Beliefs by Stephen Batchelor*

I tried a lot of philosophical works to help me deal with the ups & downs of life.  I've personally found Buddhist Philosophy to be the most helpful.  This book illustrates well that you don't need to be a Buddhist to benefit from some of this wisdom.  


*When Awareness Become Natural by Sayadaw U Tejaniya*

I practice in the tradition of [Sayadaw U Tejaniya](https://ashintejaniya.org), a Burmese teacher whose teachings try specifically to help bring mindfulness to everyday life.  His gentle style is especially beneficial to those that tend to try too hard.  He was not always a monk.  In fact, he lived a busy life running a business and dealing with substance abuse and depression.  Some teachers that follow his tradition are [Andrea Fella](http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org), [Alexis Santos](https://www.alexissantos.io), and Neesha Patel.  I find that his style really fits me well.

*Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach*

This book is a fantastic resource for those who struggle with an intense tendency to be self-critical.   It is also helpful for those experience intense emotional pain.

**Other Related & Amazing Books**:

*The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson*

He's one of my favorite authors.  This book is not about meditation, but it is one of the best things I've ever read to help my mental well-being.

*How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan*

This book is a masterpiece on the promises of psychedelic research for treating mental illnesses.  How is this related to meditation?  In the book, a section talks about the uncanny similarity between expert meditators' brain states (10,000+ hrs) and those on a high-dose psychedelic (under therapeutic settings).  I think that meditation is not necessarily the most powerful tool for addressing mental illness.  Sometimes, a more intense intervention like psychedelic therapy is needed.
