> Consider meditation and the unfolding of wisdom more like a marathon than a sprint. Be willing to learn from everything. This practice is for life. - Shwe Oo Min Sayadaw

<br />


Interested in trying meditation?  Here are some incredible resources I recommend:

**App**:  *Ten Percent*

By far the best meditation app that provides excellent instructions from some of the best meditation teachers in the world.  Although it presents the content in a secular fashion, it does so while respecting the Buddhist & Asian origins (unlike apps like headspace). It also has made a lot of effort to promote BIPOC teachers.

**Books for Beginners**: *Ten Percent Happier by Dan Harris*

The book that got me interested in starting & maintaining a meditation practice.  The casual style really resonated with me. Importantly, it doesn't oversell mediattion as a fix-all practice (hence the title).  It can take a long time to feel the benefits of Meditation so it's important to not get frustrated when things don't magically get better. :)

**Philosophical Books**:
Note - while philosophy is helpful, I believe that most of this stuff is not intellectual.  Ex: If stress is something we could un-do intellectually, why would we ever stress ourselves out (given the evidence that stress is super harmful)?

*Waking Up by Sam Harris (no relation to Dan)*

Are you a staunch Athiest or have strong allegric reaction to anything remotely spiritual?  Even if so, Sam (a long-time atheist) advocates that spirituality is essential for living an examined and happy life. The quote above is from his book.

*Buddhism without Beliefs by Stephen Batchelor*

I tried a lot of philosophical works to help me deal with the ups & downs of life.  I've personally found Buddhist Philosophy to be the most helpful.  This book illustrates well that you don't need to be a Buddhist to benefit from some of this wisdom.  

**Books for Digging Deeper**
These books may be more beneficial to those who have practiced Meditation for at least a few months.  It may take some time to get used to the jargon in these books. That said, these books truly transformed my meditation practice.  

*When Awareness Become Natural by Sayadaw U Tejaniya*

I practice in the tradition of [Sayadaw U Tejaniya](https://ashintejaniya.org), a Burmese teacher whose teachings try specifically to help bring mindfulness to everyday life. His gentle style is especially beneficial to those that tend to try too hard. Some teachers in this tradition are [Andrea Fella](http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org), [Alexis Santos](https://www.alexissantos.io), Neesha Patel, and Carol Wilson.

*Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach*

This book is a fantastic resource for those who struggle with an intense tendency to be self-critical.   

**Other Related & Amazing Books**:

*The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson*

He's one of my favorite authors.  This book is not about Meditation, but it is one of the best things I've ever read to help my mental well-being.

*How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan*

This book is a masterpiece on the promises of psychedelic research for treating mental illnesses.  How is this related to Meditation?  In the book, a section talks about the uncanny similarity of the brain states of expert meditators (10,000+ hrs) and those on a high-dose psychedelic (under therapeutic settings).
