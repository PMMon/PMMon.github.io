> Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement—when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it’s the truth. Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won’t matter how successful you become or who is in your life—you won’t enjoy any of it. Most of us could easily compile a list of goals we want to achieve or personal problems that need to be solved. But what is the real significance of every item on such a list? Everything we want to accomplish—to paint the house, learn a new language, find a better job—is something that promises that, if done, it would allow us to finally relax and enjoy our lives in the present. Generally speaking, this is a false hope. I’m not denying the importance of achieving one’s goals, maintaining one’s health, or keeping one’s children clothed and fed—but most of us spend our time seeking happiness and security without acknowledging the underlying purpose of our search. Each of us is looking for a path back to the present: We are trying to find good enough reasons to be satisfied now. Acknowledging that this is the structure of the game we are playing allows us to play it differently. How we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experience and, therefore, the quality of our lives. Mystics and contemplatives have made this claim for ages—but a growing body of scientific research now bears it out. - **Sam Harris, Waking Up**

Here's the truth: life can be difficult regardless of who you are.  We live in a tumultuous time. We are living in the dawn of catastrophic climate change, political instability, and widening inequality.  Even if you're fortunate enough to have your material needs met, there is no escaping the existential, mental, and spiritual struggle that comes with living your life. Nihilism has never been more tempting. We joke so much about our "first world problems," yet stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years.

So it's safe to say that our minds take a beating just by living every day, even for those of us that are not a part of any marginalized identities.  And although it is generally standard practice to exercise so that our bodies can take the physical stressors from day-to-day life, it is not so common to do the same for our mental well-being.  Part of this issue is cultural.  Outside of meds and expensive therapy, the west has not had a long tradition of practices or rituals for our mental health.  In fact, since the introduction of SSRIs in the 1970s, drug development for treating depression & anxiety has stalled. The drugs (like SSRIs) that exist have shown troubling signs that the effectiveness wanes over time.

I believe Meditation, a practice developed in Asia over centuries, is part of the answer to promoting mental well-being.  Of course, it is now gaining scientific recognition as well.  That said, I don't want to oversell it. Meditation practice is one of the most challenging things I've ever done.
But it has been the most rewarding thing in my life (outside of friends & family).  


Interested in trying it?  Here are some incredible resources I recommend:

App:  Ten Percent
By far the best meditation app that provides excellent instructions from some of the best meditation teachers in the world.  Although it presents the content in a secular fashion, it does so while respecting the Buddhist & Asian origins (unlike apps like headspace).

Books for Beginners:
Ten Percent Happier by Dan Harris
The book that got me interested in starting & maintaining a meditation practice.  The casual style really resonated with me. 

Philosophical Books:
Note - while philosophy is helpful, I believe that most of this stuff is not intellectual.  Ex: If stress is something we could un-do intellectually, why would we ever stress ourselves out (given the evidence that stress is super harmful)?

Waking Up by Sam Harris (no relation to Dan)
Are you a staunch Athiest?  Even if so, Sam (a long-time atheist) advocates that spirituality is essential for living an examined and happy life. The quote above is from his book.

Buddhism without Beliefs by Stephen Batchelor
I tried a lot of philosophical works to help me deal with the ups & downs of life.  I've personally found Buddhist Philosophy to be the most helpful.  This book illustrates well that you don't need to be a Buddhist to benefit from some of this wisdom.  

Books for Digging Deeper
These books may be more beneficial to those who have practiced Meditation for at least a few months.  It may take some time to get used to the jargon in these books. That said, these books truly transformed my meditation practice.  

When Awareness Become Natural by Sayadaw U Tejaniya
I practice in the tradition of Sayadaw U Tejaniya, a Burmese teacher whose teachings try specifically to help bring mindfulness to everyday life. His gentle style is especially beneficial to those that tend to try too hard. Some teachers in this tradition are Andrea Fella, Alexis Santos, Neesha Patel, and Carol Wilson.

Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach
This book is a fantastic resource for those who struggle with an intense tendency to be self-critical.   

Other Related & Amazing Books:
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson
He's one of my favorite authors.  This book is not about Meditation, but it is one of the best things I've ever read to help my mental well-being.

How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan
This book is a masterpiece on the promises of psychedelic research for treating mental illnesses.  How is this related to Meditation?  In the book, a section talks about the uncanny similarity of the brain states of expert meditators (10,000+ hrs) and those on a high-dose psychedelic (under therapeutic settings).
