When asked what he would like the general public to learn about his discipline, computer scientist Ian Parberry said the following:
> We need to do away with the myth that computer science is about computers. Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology is about microscopes or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools; it is about how we use them and what we find out when we do.

Similarly, statistics is not just about models or the theory that underlies them; these are just tools we use to solve problems. To me, statistics is the practice of using these tools to advance our understanding of important problems, not just of scientific importance but of societal importance as well.

I've never been that interested in the world of numbers in a vacuum. Although I appreciate theory a lot more now, I'm just much more interested in applied subjects than the "tools" of the statistical field.  That said, academia is pretty dominated by statisticians that are more interested in theoretical side of things. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with this, I believe there may be unintended consequences.


The first consequence is that there is a clear bias towards theoretical research that creates "tools" (see Parberry quote) seemingly in a vacuum. Some applied statisticians have griped that theoretical research is easier to compare and therefore gets more emphasis in the competitive world of academia. There is a reason the top statistics departments tend to be very theoretical.  
If the general public review theoretical statistical research, they would most likely come away with the impression that they are doing some sort of applied math.

If you look at the research top statistics departments and to most people, the research done in these departments would be fairly indistinguishable from math.






There's nothing wrong with this but this does create more bias towards t

 I became interested in Statistics because I've seen that the tools of statistics seem to be useful in all kinds of environmental problems.  

 I'm decent but I wouldn't say that I'm super good or have loved math since I was 5 or whatever.  I am not that type of person.  I begrudgingly took the necessary math classes (and later found that they are also super useful for developing a foundation of




And the thing is, there is no shortage of interesting, important, and difficult problems that require statistical expertise.  Whether it's understanding our changing climate or understanding trends in mental healthcare, there are data-related problems in so many settings.  I think it's so cool that statisticians can transcend disciplines and work in so many different areas.

So yea, the subject can seem a bit dry and too math heavy for those interested in specific disciplines.  

 the skills gained by learning statistics is such an asset
