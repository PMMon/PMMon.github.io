This is an update for my friends & family.

# Learning at UCSC
I am slowly but surely maturing as a statistician.  This quarter we are getting a lot of exposure to statistical theory.  The stats department at UCSC is very Bayesian.  So unlike at many departments,  we learn statistical inference from both perspectives: frequentists vs. bayesian philosophies.  They are pretty different, so looking at things from both perspectives can reveal a lot.  I find this dual-approach awesome.  In general, I am trying to be less firm on a particular view or model.  I think this is super freeing.

In short, most statistical techniques have been frequentist because Bayesian approaches often require more computations.  But as computational power has increased, Bayesian statistics has advanced a lot.  Bayesian methods are indispensable in areas I care about, like spatial statistics.

# TA-ing
My studies in grad school are mainly funded by being a teaching assistant.  This has been a great learning experience, and I'm enjoying it a lot.  Below is a picture of my students and me from last quarter.

# Grad school is a marathon, not a sprint
I'm trying to pace myself and nurture/maintain good habits.  Grad school life is very busy. It is challenging to balance everything but I'm doing well overall.  Also Laura still lives in Sacramento I go back and forth. I spend Tuesday-Thursday in Santa Cruz and the rest in Sacramento.  The driving back & forth has not been that bad at all. The drives fly by because I schedule calls with friends or listen to podcasts.  In fact, it helps me distance a bit from my school work.  Also I love Laura and Sac so it is worth doing.
