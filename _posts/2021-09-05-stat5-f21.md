Welcome!


This page is for my discussion sections:

* My Office Hours:
* Piazza (for questions):  
* Email (for logistics only):


### Important Information

10% of your grade in Stat5 is based on quizzes, which take place randomly during discussions. Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped at the end of the quarter. These quizzes are meant to be easy so if I accidentally make it hard, I'll grade very leniently.

Most questions should be directed to *Piazza* and not to my email. If you have a question, it's likely that other students have similar questions, so it saves time to answer questions all at once on Piazza rather than separately in private emails. Email should be reserved for things like scheduling time to meet if you can't make office hours.

### Other Stuff
