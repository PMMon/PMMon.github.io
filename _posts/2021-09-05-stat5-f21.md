If I find this circulated on the web, I will no longer post these.

Blank Sheet Method (recommended): The blank sheet method involves taking out a blank sheet of paper and writing out, from memory, everything you can about a certain topic. Itâ€™s a great method to use if you need to check to make sure you memorized something fully, or even to simply ensure that you understand the topic in full without missing any details. So you would brain dump onto the blank sheet, then go back with a red pen to add to and correct it.

### Important Information

**Missing Sections/Quizzes**: If you are sick and do not feel that coming to section is possible or wise (to avoid spreading stuff to your classmates & me), that is totally ok.  You do NOT have to send me an email.  To take the quiz, please come to my office hours. There, I'll give you the access key to take the quiz.

**Use Piazza for (most questions)**: Please direct most course-related questions to *Piazza* and NOT to my email.  [Please join STAT 5 piazza](https://piazza.com/uc_santa_cruz/fall2021/stat5/home)

**Email**:  Email should be reserved for personal & logistic questions: quiz grading or missing discussion due to medical issues, etc. My email is: shkawano @ ucsc

**Canvas Messages**: I won't check my canvas messages. Please use email or Piazza.

**Quizzes**:  There will be ten quizzes in section, some of which can be dropped. I will try to make these quizzes easy & will grade leniently.

**Doing Well**: Most people don't learn statistics (or math) from just reading or listening to lectures. Anything that takes skill is like this; just because you watch a lot of basketball doesn't mean you'll become good at it.  You have to train your intuition, which takes time & repetition! But it's not just about mindless drilling. If you get stuck on a problem, you have to identify what concept you don't quite understand and the practice problems that test that concept.  

### Other Stuff

* College can be stressful. I think Meditation is a cool way to maintain your mental (& physical) well-being. [Here's why I do it](https://sho-kawano.github.io/2021/09/27/why-meditate/)
* [Why I'm interested in Stats](https://sho-kawano.github.io/2021/09/08/why-stats/)
