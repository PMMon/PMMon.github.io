**My guidance may be more useful for ‚Äúatypical‚Äù candidates or candidates whose undergrad math background is not particularly deep.**

I came into undergrad wanting to study environmental policy.  I discovered stats my sophomore year and had to go back to community college in order to switch!  Even after switching to stats, I had ZERO intentions of going to grad school.  I honestly thought it was overkill.  But instead of being a "data analyst" I wanted to be a proper statistician which meant grad school is almost a must.
Needless to say, I had a very un-linear path to get here. Given the rise in the competitiveness of admissions, I feel very fortunate to have acceptances into a few programs in California.  üòÑ

## 1. Depth of math background matters a lot.
Admissions are becoming even more competitive. So the depth of math background is apparently becoming more important to differentiate oneself from other applicants.
You really should take Real Analysis & upper division algebra. But I‚Äôd take more if time/budget allows (stochastic processes, optimization, etc). You should also know how to code well (R, Python or whatever language) but you don't necessarily need to take a course on it.  If you don‚Äôt have a strong math background, it‚Äôs ok.  See pt 2.

## 2. ‚Ä¶ but there are ways to make it up, even after graduating.
If you want to improve your math background, I recommend NethMath, the UIUC program run by their math department that is fully online.
It is well designed for remote instruction and is cheaper than enrolling as a non-matriculated student.
It allows you to take classes while working as well.
Another plus is that the transcript they produce is indistinguishable from UIUC's normal classes.

I had some savings so I was tutored by a Math PhD to get some guidance in proof-writing for a few months.
This was SO extremely helpful for improving my mathematical maturity, though adcoms won‚Äôt care about it.
If you‚Äôre interested in that, contact someone like [Alexander Coward](https://edeeu.education/director/alexandercoward)

## 3. If you need to study & make up coursework, then do it full-time
Of course, not everyone has the means for this.
That said, if you know you lack the math/coursework background to be a competitive applicant, then seriously consider studying full-time.
Studying math while working a job is difficult and inefficient.  There‚Äôs a momentum that comes with a full-time dedication.

I mostly studied part-time and half-assed my job (during this period). In hindsight,  I would have just focus on studying for a few months & then find a job. Of course, the financial hit is significant but consider it good practice for living on a grad student budget. üòÑ

## 4. Domestic students: apply to NSF.
You‚Äôll be forced to read journals and think seriously about your research interests.  It will also make you start your application materials early. I even got to get a professor at a perspective school to write a letter of rec for me. This was huge.  Through this, I got to talk to them get to know them.

## 5. Seriously consider taking a year or two off after undergrad.

A few reasons for this:

* The years in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù have been so, so valuable to me.  Chances are, you‚Äôll mature a lot.
* I think some grad students struggle with choosing an advisor because they‚Äôve never had a real boss.
* Working under a boss or two will give you a better idea of what "a good advisor" actually means for you.
* Learn how to adult. Make sure you live frugally.
* You‚Äôll have savings!
