  bio: |+
    <br />
    I'm an aspiring statistician hoping to use my skills to tackle important societal problems.
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently I'm a PhD Student in Statistics at UC Santa Cruz.
    My research interests are in Bayesian and Spatial Statistics with primary application to ecology or climatology.
    <br />
    <br />
    I previously worked in clean energy with brief stints in air pollution research and the CA State Government.
