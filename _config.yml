  bio: |+
    <br />
    Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://mainlp.github.io/">Munich AI & NLP Research Lab (MaiNLP)</a> at 
    <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/">Ludwig-Maximilian Universit√§t</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://bplank.github.io/">Prof. Dr. Barbara Plank</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    My research focuses on LLM-based and human reasoning.
    Eager to explore what constitutes intelligence, my research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence
    and cognitive science.
    <br />
    <br />
    Before pursuing my Ph.D., I completed a Master's degree in Systems, Control, and Robotics at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)</a> in Stockholm. 
    I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
